TOP Recipe Project

This is my submission for the Recipes Project in the HTML section of The Odin Project.

The point of this project is to create a basic recipe website utilizing the fundamental HTML concepts that the course has covered thusfar. The website will start out pretty bare bones but my goal is to upgrade it over time as my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are expanded and honed throughout this course.

In addition to practicing coding in HTML, this project also serves as my first foray into GitHub repos and how they work.
